        About me

        Hello! My name is Bogdan Glechkovsky and I love working with the web. I have been studying this field for more than three years and have experience in developing various interesting projects - from simple websites and games to complex online platforms and programs.

        I am always ready to try a new approach or technology in web development. It is not difficult for me to quickly learn new technology from scratch and continue to develop my knowledge in it.

        For me, it was important to have fun when it came to web development. If the development of the project is boring and uninteresting, I will not be able to give it my best.

        I try to use not only my own knowledge, but also look for other approaches to solving problems. While studying web development, I learned how to prepare several options for solving problems using different technologies in advance.
